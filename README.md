**<h2>K-Means Clustering - Project Overview</h2>**


This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Means Clustering using Python, with the objective of clustering data into distinct groups based on their features. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for data partitioning and pattern recognition.

**<h2>Introduction</h2>**

The goal of this project is to cluster a dataset into K different clusters using the K-Means algorithm. Clustering is one of the most common exploratory data analysis techniques used to find patterns or groupings in datasets. K-Means groups data by minimizing the variance within clusters.

**<h2>Algorithm</h2>**

The K-Means Clustering Algorithm works by:

**<h2>Initializing K cluster centroids.</h2>**

Assigning each data point to the nearest cluster based on Euclidean distance.
Recalculating the centroids based on the current cluster members.
Repeating the assignment and centroid recalculation steps until the clusters stabilize or the algorithm converges.
In this project, we also cover the following topics:
Selecting the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Visualizing the clustering results.
Steps Implemented

**<h2>Data Preprocessing:</h2>**
Loaded the dataset and performed necessary preprocessing such as scaling or handling missing data.
Normalized/standardized features for better clustering performance.

**<h2>K-Means Clustering:</h2>**
Applied K-Means on the dataset with different values of K.
Evaluated the clustering using metrics such as inertia (within-cluster sum of squares).

**<h2>Elbow Method:</h2>**
Visualized the inertia values for different values of K to determine the optimal number of clusters.


**<h2>Evaluation:</h2>**
Evaluated the cluster quality and discussed the results.

Results
The results of the K-Means clustering are as follows:

Number of clusters: 5

**<h2>Dependencies</h2>**

Python 3.x

**<h2>Libraries used:</h2>**

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

**<h2>Conclusion</h2>**
This project provides a hands-on example of using K-Means clustering for partitioning datasets into distinct clusters. We explored how the Elbow Method helps in identifying the optimal number of clusters and how clustering can reveal underlying patterns in data. The results show how the algorithm effectively groups similar data points together, making it useful for exploratory analysis.
